# installing proccess:

NOTE: This Script does only work with the Termux Application for Android!
PWN-Term is untested!

``
pkg install git
``

``
git clone https://github.com/0n1cOn3/termux-wifi && cd termux-wifi
``

Setting Permissions to the executable file and run it:

``
chmod +rwx installer.sh && ./installer.sh
``

That it's.

I added fluxion for you so it will start into ubuntu if you try to hack wifi.
Good luck ï˜ƒ
